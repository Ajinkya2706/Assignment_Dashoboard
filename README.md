### State Management

- **Local State**: React `useState` for UI state (modals, forms)
- **Persistent State**: localStorage for user data, assignments, submissions
- **No external state library** - keeps it simple and performant

### Data Flow

1. **Initial Load**: Data loaded from localStorage or mock data
2. **User Actions**: State updates → localStorage sync → UI re-render
3. **Role-Based Rendering**: Conditional rendering based on `user.role`


### UI/UX Principles

1. **Natural Feel**: Organic gradients, soft shadows, smooth transitions
2. **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear typography scale, strategic use of color
3. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind breakpoints
4. **Micro-interactions**: Hover states, scale transforms, color transitions
5. **Accessibility**: Proper contrast ratios, semantic HTML

### Key Features

#### Student View
- Progress tracking with animated percentage bar
- Assignment cards with submission status
- Double-confirmation modal for submissions
- Overdue assignment indicators
- Direct Drive link access

#### Admin View
- Overview statistics with trend indicators
- Per-assignment submission tracking
- Student-level progress bars
- Individual student submission status
- Assignment CRUD operations

##  Technical Highlights

### Performance Optimizations
- Conditional rendering to minimize DOM updates
- localStorage caching to reduce re-renders
- CSS transitions over JavaScript animations

### Code Organization
- **Separation of Concerns**: Components, utilities, constants
- **Reusable Components**: Modal, Cards, Navigation
- **Pure Functions**: Helper functions with no side effects
- **Consistent Naming**: camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components

### Browser Storage
All data persists in localStorage:
- `user` - Current user session
- `assignments` - Assignment list
- `students` - Student data with submissions
